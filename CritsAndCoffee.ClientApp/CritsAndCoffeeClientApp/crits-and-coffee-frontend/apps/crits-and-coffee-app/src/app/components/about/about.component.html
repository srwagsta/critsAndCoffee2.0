        Jenkins to stay Agile

    <p>
      The world is constantly moving, spinning, creating, and rethinking, to keep pace Jenkins just builds. Linked with Git
      Jenkins makes CI/CD easy. Multi-branch development makes it easy to keep building while staying confident that the
      production site remains stable. Jenkins rebuilds on each push with the newest Docker images, keeping the project up to
      date, the tests are run, the containers are pushed to the repository, and if the master is updated Jenkins will take
      care of redeploying the site out to production. Setup programmatically Jenkins is updated with the project,
      leaving the development team to do one thing, develop.

    <p>
      Docker gives an application to scale and move as needed. Every part of this project lives inside containers.
      During development this give the project the flexibility to move machines, have a full DB that can be replicated and
      destroyed over and over, most importantly the environment is always the same. More than that, containers can fail,
      be thrown away, upgraded, segmented, all without worry of data corruption. As the need arises spin up more,
      and when all is calm take them down to keep costs low. All the containers are deployed and manged using docker-compose
      with a Kubernetes layer orchestrating everything.</p>
    <p>
      Cloud native from the ground up. AWS provides the infrastructure to manage everything from domain names, containers,
      networking, and DB availability and replication. Easy to manage and control, but by no mean the only option.
      The lightweight and portable nature of this project gives it the ability to move and deploy on any cloud platform.
